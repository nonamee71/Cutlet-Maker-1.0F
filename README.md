# Cutlet-Maker-1.0F ATM MALWARE-HACK
‘Cutlet Maker’ has been designed to make ATMs eject all of the money inside them. After the malware is installed on an ATM, it displays a message"Ho-ho-ho! Let's make some cutlets today!" along with a cartoon image of chef and cheering piece of meat.The banks are using old and slow Windows systems (mostly winXP,win7), thus enabling the cybercriminals to empty ATMs.
The price for the tool is 400 euro. It can be used unlimited times. Video proof of the software - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uPQcM1245s
